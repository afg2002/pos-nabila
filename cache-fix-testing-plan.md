# Testing Plan for Cache Error Fix

## Overview
This document outlines the testing steps to verify that the "Call to undefined method Illuminate\Cache\DatabaseStore::getRedis()" error has been resolved.

## Prerequisites
1. Implement one of the solutions from `fix-cache-error-plan.md`
2. Ensure the application is running
3. Have access to the Laravel application with appropriate permissions

## Testing Steps

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
1. Navigate to the products page in your application
2. Verify the page loads without errors
3. Check that the product list displays correctly

### 2. Create Product Test
1. Click on "Add Product" or equivalent button
2. Fill in the required product fields
3. Save the new product
4. Verify:
   - No error occurs during save
   - Success message is displayed
   - Product appears in the list
   - Product data is correct

### 3. Edit Product Test
1. Select an existing product to edit
2. Modify some product details
3. Save the changes
4. Verify:
   - No error occurs during update
   - Success message is displayed
   - Product details are updated in the list
   - Changes are reflected correctly

### 4. Delete Product Test
1. Select a product to delete
2. Confirm the deletion
3. Verify:
   - No error occurs during deletion
   - Success message is displayed
   - Product is removed from the list (or marked as deleted)

### 5. Bulk Operations Test
1. Select multiple products
2. Perform bulk operations (e.g., bulk delete, bulk price update)
3. Verify:
   - No error occurs during bulk operations
   - Success message is displayed
   - Changes are applied to selected products

### 6. Cache Verification
1. Before making any changes, note the current product data
2. Make changes to products
3. Refresh the page
4. Verify that the changes are immediately visible (cache is properly cleared)

### 7. Error Log Check
1. Check Laravel logs (`storage/logs/laravel.log`)
2. Verify no new instances of the "getRedis()" error appear
3. Look for any other cache-related errors

### 8. Performance Check
1. Monitor page load times before and after the fix
2. Ensure the fix doesn't significantly impact performance
3. Check that caching still works where expected (categories, units)

## Expected Results
- All CRUD operations on products should work without errors
- Cache should be properly cleared when products are modified
- No "getRedis()" errors in the logs
- Application performance should remain acceptable

## Troubleshooting
If issues arise after implementing the fix:

1. **Clear all caches:**
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   ```

2. **Check cache table:**
   - Verify the `cache` table exists in your database
   - Run `php artisan migrate` if needed

3. **Verify .env settings:**
   - Ensure `CACHE_STORE=database` is set correctly
   - Check database connection details

4. **Review implementation:**
   - Ensure the fix was implemented correctly
   - Check for syntax errors in the modified code

## Rollback Plan
If the fix causes unexpected issues:
1. Revert to the original `clearProductCache()` method
2. Consider switching to Redis cache driver by changing `.env`:
   ```
   CACHE_STORE=redis
   ```
3. Ensure Redis is installed and running if switching to Redis

## Completion Criteria
The fix is considered successful when:
- All product CRUD operations work without errors
- No "getRedis()" errors appear in logs
- Cache is properly invalidated when products are modified
- Application performance remains acceptable
